## Technical and Soft Skills 
During this class I learned many things. I figured out how to set up my own worksapces so I could use VSCode for everything (and because R Studio sucked). Learning R was interesting. I started off not really enjoying it but once I learned the syntax and such it is very cool how easy it makes many things that would be so much more work in a typical programming language. But honestly finally learning python was more valuable to me as its somthing I had only ever scratched the surface of, so having a reason to learn more in depth was nice.

I enjoyed working on these projects throughout the semester and I learned a lot. My favorite project was definitly the python image classification as it is what I personally imagine when I think of machine learning. I did have an idea for a project that I intend to persue this summer. I want to see if i can train a ML model that can take voice input and turn it into a midi output. Personally though I think the main thing that I learned from this class was that ML is not want I want to do for a job. I am definitly still interested in ML as a hobby though.
