# CS4375-Portfolio
Portfolio of projects and assignments done for CS4375 Intro to Machine Learning

## Overview of Machine Learning
This is an Overview of Machine Learning as written for the first assinement for this class. 

[Found here](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## C++ Project 1: Data Exploration
This project was done to compare using R and C++ to perform basic data calculations. 

[Code Here](cpp/project1/Main.cpp) and [Doc Here](cpp/project1/project1.pdf)

## Linear Models
This project was done to learn about linear models and data cleaning. 

[Regression Code Here](r/linear_models/Regression.rmd) and [Regression PDF Here](r/linear_models/Linear_Models_Regression.pdf) ([HTML Version Here](r/linear_models/Regression.html))

[Classification Code Here](r/linear_models/Classification.rmd) and [Classification PDF Here](r/linear_models/Linear_Models_Classification.pdf) ([HTML Version Here](r/linear_models/Regression.html))

## C++ Project 2: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
This project was to use C++ to implement the Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms from scratch.

[Logistic Regression Code Here](cpp/project2/Logistic%20Regression.cpp) and [Naive Bayes Code Here](cpp/project2/Naive%20Bayes.cpp) and [Doc Here](cpp/project2/Logistic%20Regresssion%20and%20Naive%20Bayes.pdf)
